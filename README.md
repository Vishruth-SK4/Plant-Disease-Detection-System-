ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Detection System
The Plant Disease Detection System is an AI-powered web application built using Streamlit and deep learning to identify plant diseases from leaf images. By analyzing uploaded leaf images, the system predicts the type of disease and provides detailed treatment recommendations in English, Kannada, and Hindi.
This project aims to help farmers and agricultural researchers detect plant diseases early, prevent crop loss, and promote smart and sustainable agriculture.
ðŸš€ Key Features
Deep Learning-Based Disease Detection â€“ Uses a trained CNN model (TensorFlow/Keras) to classify plant leaf diseases accurately.
Streamlit Web Interface â€“ User-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing instant results.
Treatment Recommendations â€“ Provides suggested remedies and precautions for identified diseases.
Multilingual Support â€“ Outputs results in English, Kannada, and Hindi for accessibility.
Voice Assistance (Optional) â€“ Reads out detected disease and treatment for farmer convenience.
Offline or Online Deployment â€“ Can be easily deployed on local systems or cloud platforms.
ðŸ§  Tech Stack
Frontend & Framework: Streamlit
Machine Learning: TensorFlow / Keras
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: NumPy, Pandas, Pillow, joblib, gTTS
Model Input: Plant leaf images (JPEG/PNG)
ðŸŒ¾ Use Case
Farmers or users can upload a photo of a diseased plant leaf through the Streamlit interface. The model analyzes the image, predicts the disease, and provides immediate treatment suggestions. The multilingual and voice-enabled design ensures accessibility to non-English speakers, making it a valuable tool for rural agricultural support.
